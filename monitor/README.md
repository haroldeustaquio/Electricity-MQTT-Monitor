## Usage

* **Initialization**
- The system initializes by configuring an MQTT client, using `broker.json` for the broker, port, and topic settings.
- Received data from MQTT topics is parsed and temporarily stored in JSON files (`part_0.json` and `part_1.json`) for processing.

* **Purpose**
- The project is designed to:
  1. **Access** real-time electrical data (e.g., voltage, current, power) through MQTT topics.
  2. **Process** this data to detect anomalies using statistical and machine learning methods.
  3. **Store** both processed results and raw data for historical analysis.
  4. **Generate Alerts** for significant deviations or abnormal readings, preparing the information for external notifications.
  5. **Support Maintenance Decisions** by identifying patterns and trends in electrical behavior over time.

> [!NOTE]
> - ``MQTT Configuration``: Ensure broker details are set correctly in `broker.json`.

## Functions

### `file_handling.py`

- **`save_json`**:  
  Saves data to a specified JSON file within a given folder. If the folder does not exist, it creates the folder before saving.

- **`read_json`**:  
  Reads and returns data from a specified JSON file. Handles exceptions if the file does not exist or contains invalid data.

- **`load_update`**:  
  Reads an existing JSON file, appends new data to it if the data is in a list format, and saves the updated list back to the file. Ensures data integrity by creating the file if it does not exist.



### `mqtt_extraction.py`

- **`return_broker_data`**:  
  Retrieves broker configuration details (broker, port, topics) from a JSON file (`broker.json`). Ensures connectivity settings are accessible for the MQTT client.

- **`on_connect`**:  
  Handles the MQTT clientâ€™s connection to the broker. Prints connection status messages and subscribes to the topics specified in the broker configuration.

- **`on_message`**:  
  Processes incoming MQTT messages:
  1. Decodes the JSON payload.
  2. Validates the structure of the incoming message.
  3. Splits and saves parts of the message into temporary JSON files (`part_0.json`, `part_1.json`) for further processing.

- **`save_data`**:  
  Combines and processes data from the temporary JSON files. Adds a timestamp and updates dedicated JSON files for **voltage**, **current**, and **power**.


### Alert Detector

#### `voltage_detector.py`

- **Purpose**:  
  Detects anomalies in voltage data using statistical methods (IQR, Z-Score) and machine learning techniques (ARIMA, Isolation Forest).

- **Criteria for Alert Generation**:  
  An alert is triggered when:
  1. At least two methods detect an anomaly.
  2. The current voltage value deviates from the range defined by the last two readings (concordance check).



#### `current_detector.py`

- **Purpose**:  
  Monitors RMS current data for anomalies using IQR, ARIMA, and Isolation Forest.

- **Criteria for Alert Generation**:  
  An alert is generated when:
  1. At least two detection methods indicate an anomaly.
  2. The current RMS value falls outside the range of the last two readings.



#### `power_detector.py`

- **Purpose**:  
  Identifies anomalies in active power data using IQR, Z-Score, ARIMA, and Isolation Forest.

- **Criteria for Alert Generation**:  
  An alert is raised when:
  1. Two or more methods flag an anomaly.
  2. The current power value deviates from the range defined by the last two readings.





### Storage Files

#### **``data/``**
- **``history.json``**: Stores all the information received from MQTT to keep a complete record of the data.
- **``last_update.json``**: Stores only the last update received, allowing quick access to the most recent information.
- **``part_1.json``** and **``part_2.json``**: These are temporary files used to join partial messages. These files help to concatenate the data that, at the end of the process, is saved in ``history.json``.


#### **``electrical-data/``**
- **`current.json`**: Contains data on the current in each phase, used to monitor load and detect overloads.
- **`potency.json`**: Includes total active, reactive, and apparent power data, as well as power factor and frequency, to evaluate system efficiency and stability.
- **`voltage.json`**: Stores voltage measurements across phases, essential for assessing voltage stability and detecting imbalances.


#### **`alerts/`**
- **`alerts.json`**:  Contains the latest generated alert, including details about voltage, current, and power anomalies. This file is updated whenever a new alert is triggered.

- **`history_alerts.json`**:  Maintains a historical record of all alerts generated over time. 

This files serves as a reference for tracking past anomalies and is also used as the source for sending external notifications (e.g., via WhatsApp).

## Electrical Analysis

### Voltage

**Instantaneous energy** in electrical systems represents the total magnitude of voltage or current at a specific moment. It combines all contributions from different voltage or current sources into a single metric, offering a unified view of the total energy flowing in the system.

This measure is typically calculated using the **Euclidean norm** (or quadratic magnitude) of individual voltage or current measurements. The general formula for instantaneous energy with multiple voltages is:

\[
\text{Instantaneous Energy} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} V_i^2}
\]


where $V_i$ represents each voltage measurement (e.g., `Voltage A`, `Voltage B`, `Voltage C`, `Voltage AB`, `Voltage BC`, `Voltage CA`). This calculation provides a single metric that includes all voltage contributions in the system.

**Benefits of Using Instantaneous Energy for Anomaly Detection**
    * Captures Total Voltage Magnitude
    * Preserves the Distinct Nature of Voltages
    * Detects Global System Changes
    * Enhances Sensitivity to Peaks
